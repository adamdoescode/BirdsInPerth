# Perth bird observations

Analysis of Perth birdwatching observations extracted from Birdata.

The dataset is composed of a large number of observations and surveys (all linked) and covers the entirety of the Perth NRM (Natural Resource Management) area.

Credit to Tegan Douglas for extracting the data for me initially.
